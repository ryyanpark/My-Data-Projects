## Bellabeat Queries - PostgreSQL in DBeaver

##### List all columns from dataset; Check to see which column names are shared across tables
```
SELECT 
	c."column_name",
 	COUNT(table_name) 
FROM 
	information_schema."columns" c 
WHERE
	table_schema = 'public' --change
GROUP BY 
	1;
```

##### Check if column is in every table
```
SELECT
 	"table_name",
 	SUM(CASE
     		WHEN column_name = 'Id' THEN 1 --change
   		ELSE 0
 	END) AS has_id_column
FROM
 	information_schema."columns" c 
WHERE 
 	table_schema = 'public' --change
GROUP BY
	1
ORDER BY
	1 ASC;
``` 
 
##### Table, column, data type info
```
SELECT
	table_name,
	column_name,
	data_type
FROM
	information_schema.columns
WHERE
	table_schema = 'public';
```    
    
##### This query checks to make sure that each table has a column of a date or time related type
##### If your column types were detected properly prior to upload this table should be empty if HAVING = 0
```
SELECT
	table_name,
 	SUM(CASE
		WHEN data_type IN ('date','timestamp without time zone','TIMESTAMP', 'DATETIME', 'TIME', 'DATE') THEN 1
		ELSE 0
 	END) AS "has_time_info"
FROM
	information_schema."columns" c 
WHERE
	table_schema = 'public' 
	AND
	data_type IN ('date', 'timestamp without time zone', 'TIMESTAMP', 'DATETIME', 'DATE')
GROUP BY
 	1
HAVING
 	SUM(CASE
		WHEN data_type IN ('date','timestamp without time zone','TIMESTAMP', 'DATETIME', 'TIME', 'DATE') THEN 1
		ELSE 0
 	END) = 1;
```   
   
##### If we found that we have columns of the type DATETIME, TIMESTAMP, or DATE we can use this query to check for their names
```
SELECT
	CONCAT(table_catalog,'.',table_schema,'.',table_name) AS table_path,
	table_name,
	column_name,
	data_type 
FROM
 	information_schema."columns" c 
WHERE
	data_type IN ('date', 'timestamp without time zone', 'TIMESTAMP', 'DATETIME', 'DATE');
```

##### We now know that every table has an "Id" column but we don't know how to join the dates
##### If we find that not every table has a DATETIME, TIMESTAMP, or DATE column we use their names to check for what might be date-related
##### Here we check to see if the column name has any of the keywords below:
##### date, minute, daily, hourly, day, seconds
```
SELECT
	table_name,
	column_name,
	data_type
FROM
 	information_schema."columns" c 
WHERE
	LOWER(column_name) ~ 'date|minute|daily|hourly|day|seconds'
	AND table_schema = 'public';	  
```
	
##### In the dailyActivity_merged table we saw that there is a column called ActivityDate, let's check to see what it looks like
##### One way to check if something follows a particular pattern is to use a regular expression.
##### In this case we use the regular expression for a timestamp format to check if the column follows that pattern.
##### The is_timestamp column demonstrates that this column is a valid timestamp column
```
SELECT
	"ActivityDate",
	CASE WHEN "ActivityDate"::VARCHAR(50) ~ '^\d{4}-\d{1,2}-\d{1,2}[T ]\d{1,2}:\d{1,2}:\d{1,2}(\.\d{1,6})? *(([+-]\d{1,2}(:\d{1,2})?)|Z|UTC)?$' 
	THEN 'TRUE' ELSE 'FALSE' END AS is_timestamp
FROM
	dailyactivity_merged dm  
LIMIT
	10;
```
 
##### To quickly check if all columns follow the timestamp pattern we can take the minimum value of the boolean expression across the entire table
```
SELECT
	CASE
		WHEN MIN(CASE WHEN "ActivityHour"::VARCHAR(50) ~ '^\d{4}-\d{1,2}-\d{1,2}[T ]\d{1,2}:\d{1,2}:\d{1,2}(\.\d{1,6})? *(([+-]\d{1,2}(:\d{1,2})?)|Z|UTC)?$' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)>0 THEN 'Valid'
	 	ELSE 'Not Valid'
	END AS valid_test
FROM
	hourlyintensities_merged hm;
```

##### Say we want to do an analysis based upon daily data, this could help us to find tables that might be at the day level
```
SELECT
	DISTINCT table_name
FROM
	information_schema."columns" c 
WHERE
	LOWER(table_name) ~ 'day|daily';
```

##### Now that we have a list of tables we should look at the columns that are shared among the tables
```
SELECT
	column_name,
	data_type,
	COUNT(table_name) AS table_count
FROM
	information_schema."columns" c 
WHERE
	LOWER(table_name) ~ 'day|daily'
GROUP BY
	1,
	2;
```

##### Now that we have a list of tables we should look at the columns that are shared among the tables
##### We should also make certain that the data types align between tables
```
SELECT
	column_name,
	table_name,
	data_type
FROM
	information_schema."columns" c 
WHERE
	LOWER(table_name) ~ 'day|daily'
	AND column_name IN 
	(SELECT
		column_name
	FROM
		information_schema."columns" c 
	WHERE
   		LOWER(table_name) ~ 'day|daily'
 	GROUP BY
